Docker containers and services can connect docker workload as well as to non-Docker workloads. 

Docker’s networking subsystem is pluggable, using drivers. Several drivers exist by default, and provide core networking functionality:

bridge: The default network driver. 

host:  use the host’s networking directly.  

overlay: Overlay networks connect multiple Docker daemons together. 

macvlan: Macvlan networks allow you to assign a MAC address to a container, making it appear as a physical device on your network. 

none: For this container, disable all networking. 

Network plugins: You can install and use third-party network plugins with Docker. 


Overlay Networks: 

>> An overlay network called ingress, which handles control and data traffic related to swarm services. When you create a swarm service and do not connect it to a user-defined overlay network, it connects to the ingress network by default.

>> A bridge network called docker_gwbridge, which connects the individual Docker daemon to the other daemons participating in the swarm.
 

create user-defined overlay networks using docker network create. 

$ docker network create \
  --driver overlay \
  --ingress \
  --subnet=10.11.0.0/16 \
  --gateway=10.11.0.2 \
  --opt com.docker.network.driver.mtu=1200 \
  my-ingress
