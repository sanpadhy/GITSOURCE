Docker image to build:  

            sudo docker build -t dns_image .

Running Docker Image:
        ex:
                sudo docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name drone dns_image:latest

run --> container image to run. 

You can also create the docker container with following command: 
	
	sudo docker container -d --name webserver -P 80:80 nginx

-d --> (detached) to run in the background.   

-p 80:80 --> Default listens on tcp port 80 and local host port 80. 

Docker image need 
1) To Create virtual network: 
	docker network create test 
   Attach the container to network 
	docker container run -d --network=test --name=web nginx   

2)  Generally docker containers are aphemeral or stateless. Means it's state never saved. To 
maintain the statefulless, create a volume and attach the container to that volume. 

   	docker volume create test 
  
    	docker container run --rm -v test:/myvolume debian: Jessie/bin/bash

In dockerfile, need to have COPY -- copies the file from host's local file system into container image. 

DOCKERFILE 
--------------------------

1.
Multi-stage builds allow you to drastically reduce the size of your final image, without struggling to reduce the number of intermediate layers and files.



2.  
FROM ubuntu:18.04
COPY . /app
RUN make /app
CMD python /app/app.py
ENV PATH /usr/local/postgres-$PG_MAJOR/bin:$PATH

Each instruction creates one layer:

    FROM creates a layer from the ubuntu:18.04 Docker image.
	Note: We recommend the Alpine image as it is tightly controlled and small in size (currently under 5 MB)

    COPY adds files from your Docker clientâ€™s current directory.
	
    RUN builds your application with make.
	Note: Avoid RUN apt-get upgrade and dist-upgrade. Always combine RUN apt-get update with apt-get install in the same RUN statement. 
	RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    		package-bar \
    		package-baz \
    		package-foo	

    CMD specifies what command to run within the container.
	Note: CMD should be given an interactive shell, such as bash, python and perl. 

    EXPOSE instruction indicates the ports on which a container listens for connections.

    ENV to update the PATH environment variable for the software your container installs. 
	Note: 

    VOLUME instruction should be used to expose any database storage area, configuration storage, or files/folders created by your docker container. 

3. 
LABEL : add labels to your image to help organize images by project, record licensing information, to aid in automation, or for other reasons.

# Set multiple labels at once, using line-continuation characters to break long lines
LABEL vendor=ACME\ Incorporated \
      com.example.is-beta= \
      com.example.is-production="" \
      com.example.version="0.0.1-beta" \
      com.example.release-date="2015-02-12"
