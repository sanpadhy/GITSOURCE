add ( i tern): Add an item to the end of the list.
remove (): Remove the first item in the list.
peek ( ) : Return the top of the queue.
is Empty(): Return true if and only if the queue is empty.

Queues can be implemented in arrays and linkedlist and both are same as long as inserted at back and 
remove from front. 

One place where queues are often used is in breadth-first search or in implementing a cache.
In breadth-first search, for example, we used a queue to store a list of the nodes that we need to process.
Each time we process a node, we add its adjacent nodes to the back of the queue. This allows us to process
nodes in the order in which they are viewed.
