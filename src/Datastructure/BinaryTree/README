Type of Trees: 

1) Trees 
2) Binary Tree 
3) Binary Search Tree 
4) Balanced Tree 
5) Unbalanced Tree 
6) Complete Binary Tree 
A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level of the tree is fully filled, except for perhaps the
last level. To the extent that the last level is filled, it is filled left to right.
A min-heap is a complete binary tree
7) Full Binary Tree 
A full binary tree is a binary tree in which every node has either zero or two children. That is, no nodes have
only one child.
8) Perfect Binary Trees
A perfect binary tree is one that is both full and complete. All leaf nodes will be at the same level, and this
level has the maximum number of nodes.

 




A binary tree is a tree in which each node has up to two children. Not all trees are binary trees. For example,
this tree is not a binary tree. You could call it a ternary tree.

When given a tree question, many candidates assume the interviewer means a binary search tree. Be sure
to ask. A binary search tree imposes the condition that, for each node, its left descendents are less than or
equal to the current node, which is less than the right descendents.
