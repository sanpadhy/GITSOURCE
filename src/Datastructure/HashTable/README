/*
A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values for highly efficient lookup.

1) 
compute the key's hash code, which will usually be an int or long.

2) 
map the hash code to an index in the array.
hash (key)% array_length

3)
Store the key and value in this index.

To retrieve the value pair by its key, you repeat this process.

good implementation that keeps collisions to a minimum, in which case
the lookup time is 0( 1).

Alternatively, we can implement the hash table with a balanced binary search tree. This gives us an O( log N)
lookup time.
