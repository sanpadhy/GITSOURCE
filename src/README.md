STRING 
-----------

Problem 7
Given the mapping a = 1, b = 2, ... z = 26, and an encoded message, count the number of ways it can be decoded.

For example, the message '111' would give 3, since it could be decoded as 'aaa', 'ka', and 'ak'.

You can assume that the messages are decodable. For example, '001' is not allowed.


Problem 13 
Given an integer k and a string s, find the length of the longest substring that contains at most k distinct characters.

For example, given s = "abcba" and k = 2, the longest substring with k distinct characters is "bcb".



Problem 29

Run-length encoding is a fast and simple method of encoding strings. The basic idea is to represent repeated successive characters as a single count and character. For example, the string "AAAABBBCCDAA" would be encoded as "4A3B2C1D2A".

Implement run-length encoding and decoding. You can assume the string to be encoded have no digits and consists solely of alphabetic characters. You can assume the string to be decoded is valid.


Problem 103

Given a string and a set of characters, return the shortest substring containing all the characters in the set.

For example, given the string "figehaeci" and the set of characters {a, e, i}, you should return "aeci".

If there is no substring containing all the characters in the set, return null.

Problem 276 (TO DO)

Implement an efficient string matching algorithm.

That is, given a string of length N and a pattern of length k, write a program that searches for the pattern in the string with less than O(N * k) worst-case time complexity.

If the pattern is found, return the start index of its location. If not, return False.

Problem 253
Given a string and a number of lines k, print the string in zigzag form. In zigzag, characters are printed out diagonally from top left to bottom right until reaching the kth line, then back up to top right, and so on.

For example, given the sentence "thisisazigzag" and k = 4, you should print:

t     a     g
 h   s z   a
  i i   i z
   s     g


Problem 153

Find an efficient algorithm to find the smallest distance (measured in number of words) between any two given words in a string.

For example, given words "hello", and "world" and a text content of "dog cat hello cat dog dog hello cat world", return 1 because there's only one word "cat" in between the two words.





BITWISE OPERATOR 
------------------------------------

Problem 40
Given an array of integers where every integer occurs three times except for one integer, which only occurs once, find and return the non-duplicated integer.

For example, given [6, 1, 3, 3, 3, 6, 6], return 1. Given [13, 19, 13, 13], return 19.


Problem 109
Given an unsigned 8-bit integer, swap its even and odd bits. The 1st and 2nd bit should be swapped, the 3rd and 4th bit should be swapped, and so on.

For example, 10101010 should be 01010101. 11100010 should be 11010001.

Bonus: Can you do this in one line?



P
roblem 103
Problem 137
Implement a bit array.

A bit array is a space efficient array that holds a value of 1 or 0 at each index.

    init(size): initialize the array with size
    set(i, val): updates index at i with val where val is either 1 or 0.
    get(i): gets the value at index i.


Problem 161

Given a 32-bit integer, return the number with its bits reversed.

For example, given the binary number 1111 0000 1111 0000 1111 0000 1111 0000, return 0000 1111 0000 1111 0000 1111 0000 1111.


Problem 310 

Write an algorithm that finds the total number of set bits in all integers between 1 and N.


Problem 217

We say a number is sparse if there are no adjacent ones in its binary representation. For example, 21 (10101) is sparse, but 22 (10110) is not. For a given input N, find the smallest sparse number greater than or equal to N.

Do this in faster than O(N log N) time.


Problem 

Given a 32-bit positive integer N, determine whether it is a power of four in faster than O(log N) time.


Problem 248
Find the maximum of two numbers without using any if-else statements, branching, or direct comparisons.


Problem 161: 
Given a 32-bit integer, return the number with its bits reversed.

For example, given the binary number 1111 0000 1111 0000 1111 0000 1111 0000, return 0000 1111 0000 1111 0000 1111 0000 1111.

Problem 338

Given an integer n, find the next biggest integer with the same number of 1-bits on. For example, given the number 6 (0110 in binary), return 9 (1001).













MATHMATICS 
------------------------

abs () is a built-in function which works with integer, float and complex numbers also.

fabs () is defined in math module which doesnâ€™t work with complex numbers.

Problem 61
Implement integer exponentiation. That is, implement the pow(x, y) function, where x and y are integers and returns x^y.

Do this faster than the naive method of repeated multiplication.

For example, pow(2, 10) should return 1024.


Problem 362

A strobogrammatic number is a positive number that appears the same after being rotated 180 degrees. 
For example, 16891 is strobogrammatic.

Create a program that finds all strobogrammatic numbers with N digits.

Problem 339 
Given an array of numbers and a number k, determine if there are three entries in the array which add up to the 
specified number k. For example, given [20, 303, 3, 4, 25] and k = 49, return true as 20 + 4 + 25 = 49.

Sort and take one number which might be part of 3 series and check for pair whise sum is equals of sum - current. 

JUMP PROBLEMS
-------------------

Problem 322

Starting from 0 on a number line, you would like to make a series of jumps that lead to the integer N.

On the ith jump, you may move exactly i places to the left or right.

Find a path with the fewest number of jumps required to get from 0 to N.





RECURSIVE 
-------------------

Problem 37
The power set of a set is the set of all its subsets. Write a function that, given a set, generates its power set.

For example, given the set {1, 2, 3}, it should return {{}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}.

You may also use a list or array to represent a set.


Problem 353

You are given a histogram consisting of rectangles of different heights. These heights are represented in an input 
list, such that [1, 3, 2, 5] corresponds to the following diagram:

      x
      x  
  x   x
  x x x
x x x x

Determine the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed only from the bars of the histogram. For the diagram 
above, for example, this would be six, representing the 2 x 3 area at the bottom right.


Problem 320

Given a string, find the length of the smallest window that contains every distinct character. Characters may appear more than once in the window.

For example, given "jiujitsu", you should return 5, corresponding to the final five letters.


Problem 233
Implement the function fib(n), which returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence, using only O(1) space.



ARRAY
-------------------------------

Problem 1: 
Given a list of numbers, return whether any two sums to k. For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.


Problem 2
Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

Follow-up: what if you can't use division?


Problem 9

Given a list of integers, write a function that returns the largest sum of non-adjacent numbers. Numbers can be 0 or negative.

For example, [2, 4, 6, 8] should return 12, since we pick 4 and 8. [5, 1, 1, 5] should return 10, since we pick 5 and 5.

Problem 35
Given an array of strictly the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B', segregate the values of the array so that all the Rs come first, the Gs come second, and the Bs come last. You can only swap elements of the array.

Do this in linear time and in-place.

For example, given the array ['G', 'B', 'R', 'R', 'B', 'R', 'G'], it should become ['R', 'R', 'R', 'G', 'G', 'B', 'B'].


Problem 49: 
Given an array of numbers, find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of the array.

For example, given the array [34, -50, 42, 14, -5, 86], the maximum sum would be 137, since we would take elements 42, 14, -5, and 86.

Given the array [-5, -1, -8, -9], the maximum sum would be 0, since we would not take any elements.

Do this in O(N) time.


Problem 99
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

For example, given [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2], the longest consecutive element sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Return its length: 4.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

Problem 140
Given an array of integers in which two elements appear exactly once and all other elements appear exactly twice, find the two elements that appear only once.

For example, given the array [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 2, 6, 10], return 4 and 8. The order does not matter.

Follow-up: Can you do this in linear time and constant space?


Problem 189
Given an array of elements, return the length of the longest subarray where all its elements are distinct.

For example, given the array [5, 1, 3, 5, 2, 3, 4, 1], return 5 as the longest subarray of distinct elements is [5, 2, 3, 4, 1].


Problem 190 
Given a circular array, compute its maximum subarray sum in O(n) time.

For example, given [8, -1, 3, 4], return 15 as we choose the numbers 3, 4, and 8 where the 8 is obtained from wrapping around.

Given [-4, 5, 1, 0], return 6 as we choose the numbers 5 and 1.

Problem 99
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

For example, given [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2], the longest consecutive element sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Return its length: 4.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.


Problem 197

Given an array and a number k that's smaller than the length of the array, rotate the array to the right k elements in-place.


Problem 243

Given an array of numbers N and an integer k, your task is to split N into k partitions such that the maximum 
sum of any partition is minimized. Return this sum.

For example, given N = [5, 1, 2, 7, 3, 4] and k = 3, you should return 8, since the optimal partition 
is [5, 1, 2], [7], [3, 4].


Problem 271

Given a sorted list of integers of length N, determine if an element x is in the list without performing any 
multiplication, division, or bit-shift operations.

Do this in O(log N) time.


Problem 273

A fixed point in an array is an element whose value is equal to its index. Given a sorted array of distinct 
elements, return a fixed point, if one exists. Otherwise, return False.

For example, given [-6, 0, 2, 40], you should return 2. Given [1, 5, 7, 8], you should return False.


Problem 296

Given a sorted array, convert it into a height-balanced binary search tree.


Problem 358 

Create a data structure that performs all the following operations in O(1) time:

    plus: Add a key with value 1. If the key already exists, increment its value by one.
    minus: Decrement the value of a key. If the key's value is currently 1, remove it.
    get_max: Return a key with the highest value.
    get_min: Return a key with the lowest value.

In the above problem plus and minus, you wanted to do it in O(1) time 

    use hashmap with key(value) and value(count). 

To get the max and min, have a separate list for max and min. 

or have a arry of structure having 

--> key 
--> value 
--> current max 
--> current min

add() -- will add the count with count 

delete() -- reduce the count 


Problem 364

Describe an algorithm to compute the longest increasing subsequence of an array of numbers in O(n log n) time.


problem 224

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given a sorted array, find the smallest positive integer that is not the sum of a subset of the array.

For example, for the input [1, 2, 3, 10], you should return 7.

Do this in O(N) time.

Problem 198

Given a set of distinct positive integers, find the largest subset such that every pair of elements in the subset (i, j) 
satisfies either i % j = 0 or j % i = 0.

For example, given the set [3, 5, 10, 20, 21], you should return [5, 10, 20]. Given [1, 3, 6, 24], return [1, 3, 6, 24].

Problem 186

Given an array of positive integers, divide the array into two subsets such that the difference between the sum of 
the subsets is as small as possible.

For example, given [5, 10, 15, 20, 25], return the sets {10, 25} and {5, 15, 20}, which has a difference of 5, 
which is the smallest possible difference.

Problem 249

Given an array of integers, find the maximum XOR of any two elements.


Problem 245

You are given an array of integers, where each element represents the maximum number of steps that can be jumped 
going forward from that element. Write a function to return the minimum number of jumps you must take in order to 
get from the start to the end of the array.

For example, given [6, 2, 4, 0, 5, 1, 1, 4, 2, 9], you should return 2, as the optimal solution involves jumping from 
6 to 5, and then from 5 to 9.

Problem 203: 
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand. Find the minimum 
element in O(log N) time. You may assume the array does not contain duplicates.

For example, given [5, 7, 10, 3, 4], return 3.

SPARSE ARRAY 
--------------------

Problem 134

You have a large array with most of the elements as zero.

Use a more space-efficient data structure, SparseArray, that implements the same interface:

    init(arr, size): initialize with the original large array and size.
    set(i, val): updates index at i with val.
    get(i): gets the value at index i.





STACK 
-------------------

Problem 27 
Given a string of round, curly, and square open and closing brackets, return whether the brackets are balanced (well-formed).

For example, given the string "([])", you should return true.

Given the string "([)]" or "((()", you should return false.


Problem 43
Implement a stack that has the following methods:

    push(val), which pushes an element onto the stack
    pop(), which pops off and returns the topmost element of the stack. If there are no elements in the stack, then it should throw an error or return null.
    max(), which returns the maximum value in the stack currently. If there are no elements in the stack, then it should throw an error or return null.

Each method should run in constant time.


Problem 53
Implement a queue using two stacks. Recall that a queue is a FIFO (first-in, first-out) data structure with the following methods: enqueue, which inserts an element into the queue, and dequeue, which removes it.

Problem 154: 
Implement a stack API using only a heap. A stack implements the following methods:

    push(item), which adds an element to the stack
    pop(), which removes and returns the most recently added element (or throws an error if there is nothing on the stack)

Recall that a heap has the following operations:

    push(item), which adds a new key to the heap
    pop(), which removes and returns the max value of the heap


Problem 365

A quack is a data structure combining properties of both stacks and queues. It can be viewed as a list of elements 
written left to right such that three operations are possible:

    push(x): add a new item x to the left end of the list
    pop(): remove and return the item on the left end of the list
    pull(): remove the item on the right end of the list.

Implement a quack using three stacks and O(1) additional memory, so that the amortized time for any push, pop, or 
pull operation is O(1).


Problem: 180

Given a stack of N elements, interleave the first half of the stack with the second half reversed using only one other queue. This should be done in-place.

Recall that you can only push or pop from a stack, and enqueue or dequeue from a queue.

For example, if the stack is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], it should become [1, 5, 2, 4, 3]. If the stack is [1, 2, 3, 4], it should become [1, 4, 2, 3].

Hint: Try working backwards from the end state.










QUEUE 
------------------------

PROBLEM 180

Given a stack of N elements, interleave the first half of the stack with the second half reversed using only 
one other queue. This should be done in-place.

Recall that you can only push or pop from a stack, and enqueue or dequeue from a queue.

For example, if the stack is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], it should become [1, 5, 2, 4, 3]. If the stack is [1, 2, 3, 4], it should 
become [1, 4, 2, 3].

Hint: Try working backwards from the end state.










CIRCULAR QUEUE 
------------------------

Problem 225

There are N prisoners standing in a circle, waiting to be executed. The executions are carried out starting with the kth person, and removing every successive kth person going clockwise until there is no one left.

Given N and k, write an algorithm to determine where a prisoner should stand in order to be the last survivor.

For example, if N = 5 and k = 2, the order of executions would be [2, 4, 1, 5, 3], so you should return 3.

Bonus: Find an O(log N) solution if k = 2.






HASH MAP / MAP / DICTIONARY (KEY-VALUE)
-------------------------------









SET 
------------------




LINKED LIST 
------------------

Problem 20
Given two singly linked lists that intersect at some point, find the intersecting node. The lists are non-cyclical.

For example, given A = 3 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10 and B = 99 -> 1 -> 8 -> 10, return the node with value 8.

In this example, assume nodes with the same value are the exact same node objects.

Do this in O(M + N) time (where M and N are the lengths of the lists) and constant space.


Problem 26 
Given a singly linked list and an integer k, remove the kth last element from the list. k is guaranteed to be smaller than the length of the list.

The list is very long, so making more than one pass is prohibitively expensive.

Do this in constant space and in one pass.


Problem 78
Given k sorted singly linked lists, write a function to merge all the lists into one sorted singly linked list.


Problem 127 

Let's represent an integer in a linked list format by having each node represent a digit in the number. The nodes make up the number in reversed order.

For example, the following linked list:

1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 is the number 54321.

Given two linked lists in this format, return their sum in the same linked list format.

For example, given

9 -> 9 5 -> 2 return 124 (99 + 25) as:

4 -> 2 -> 1

Problem 143
Given a pivot x, and a list lst, partition the list into three parts.

    The first part contains all elements in lst that are less than x
    The second part contains all elements in lst that are equal to x
    The third part contains all elements in lst that are larger than x Ordering within a part can be arbitrary.

For example, given x = 10 and lst = [9, 12, 3, 5, 14, 10, 10], one partition may be [9, 3, 5, 10, 10, 12, 14]


Problem 145: 
Given the head of a singly linked list, swap every two nodes and return its head.

For example, given 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4, return 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3.

Problem 305: 
Given a linked list, remove all consecutive nodes that sum to zero. Print out the remaining nodes.

For example, suppose you are given the input 3 -> 4 -> -7 -> 5 -> -6 -> 6. In this case, you should first 
remove 3 -> 4 -> -7, then -6 -> 6, leaving only 5.




Given a linked list, rearrange the node values such that they appear in alternating low -> high -> low -> high ... form. For example, given 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, you should return 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5 -> 4.


Given a linked list of numbers and a pivot k, partition the linked list so that all nodes less than k come before nodes greater than or equal to k.

For example, given the linked list 5 -> 1 -> 8 -> 0 -> 3 and k = 3, the solution could be 1 -> 0 -> 5 -> 8 -> 3.











GRAPH 
---------------------------

Problem 262

A bridge in a connected (undirected) graph is an edge that, if removed, causes the graph to become disconnected. 
Find all the bridges in a graph.


Problem 299

A group of houses is connected to the main water plant by means of a set of pipes. A house can either be connected by a set of pipes extending directly to the plant, or indirectly by a pipe to a nearby house which is otherwise connected.

For example, here is a possible configuration, where A, B, and C are houses, and arrows represent pipes: A <--> B <--> C <--> plant

Each pipe has an associated cost, which the utility company would like to minimize. Given an undirected graph of pipe connections, return the lowest cost configuration of pipes such that each house has access to water.

In the following setup, for example, we can remove all but the pipes from plant to A, plant to B, and B to C, for a total cost of 16.

pipes = {
    'plant': {'A': 1, 'B': 5, 'C': 20},
    'A': {'C': 15},
    'B': {'C': 10},
    'C': {}
}


BINARY TREE 
--------------------------

Problem 8
A unival tree (which stands for "universal value") is a tree where all nodes under it have the same value.

Given the root to a binary tree, count the number of unival subtrees.

For example, the following tree has 5 unival subtrees:

   0
  / \
 1   0
    / \
   1   0
  / \
 1   1



Problem 36
Given the root to a binary search tree, find the second largest node in the tree.


Problem 48
Given pre-order and in-order traversals of a binary tree, write a function to reconstruct the tree.

For example, given the following preorder traversal:

[a, b, d, e, c, f, g]

And the following inorder traversal:

[d, b, e, a, f, c, g]

You should return the following tree:

    a
   / \
  b   c
 / \ / \
d  e f  g



Problem 50 
Suppose an arithmetic expression is given as a binary tree. Each leaf is an integer and each internal node is one of '+', 'âˆ’', 'âˆ—', or '/'.

Given the root to such a tree, write a function to evaluate it.

For example, given the following tree:

    *
   / \
  +    +
 / \  / \
3  2  4  5

You should return 45, as it is (3 + 2) * (4 + 5).

Problem 80
Given the root of a binary tree, return a deepest node. For example, in the following tree, return d.

    a
   / \
  b   c
 /
d


Problem 83

Invert a binary tree.

For example, given the following tree:

    a
   / \
  b   c
 / \  /
d   e f

should become:

  a
 / \
 c  b
 \  / \
  f e  d



Problem 89: 
Determine whether a tree is a valid binary search tree.

A binary search tree is a tree with two children, left and right, and satisfies the constraint that the key in the left child must be less than or equal to the root and the key in the right child must be greater than or equal to the root.

Given a tree, return the size of the largest tree/subtree that is a BST.



Problem 94

Given a binary tree of integers, find the maximum path sum between two nodes. The path must go through at least one node, and does not need to go through the root.


Problem 110 
Given a binary tree, return all paths from the root to leaves.

   1
  / \
 2   3
    / \
   4   5

it should return [[1, 2], [1, 3, 4], [1, 3, 5]].


Problem 112
Given two non-empty binary trees s and t, check whether tree t has exactly the same structure and node values with a subtree of s. A subtree of s is a tree consists of a node in s and all of this node's descendants. The tree s could also be considered as a subtree of itself.


Problem 115 

Given two non-empty binary trees s and t, check whether tree t has exactly the same structure and node values with a subtree of s. A subtree of s is a tree consists of a node in s and all of this node's descendants. The tree s could also be considered as a subtree of itself.


Problem 117
Given a binary tree, return the level of the tree with minimum sum.


Problem 133

Given a node in a binary tree, return the next bigger element, also known as the inorder successor. (NOTE: I'm assuming this is a binary search tree, because otherwise, the problem makes no sense at all)

For example, the inorder successor of 22 is 30.

   10
  /  \
 5    30
     /  \
   22    35

You can assume each node has a parent pointer.


Problem 135
Given a binary tree, find a minimum path sum from root to a leaf.

For example, the minimum path in this tree is [10, 5, 1, -1], which has sum 15.

  10
 /  \
5    5
 \     \
   2    1
       /
     -1



Problem 179

Given the sequence of keys visited by a postorder traversal of a binary search tree, reconstruct the tree.

For example, given the sequence 2, 4, 3, 8, 7, 5, you should construct the following tree:

    5
   / \
  3   7
 / \   \
2   4   8


Problem 343

Given a binary search tree and a range [a, b] (inclusive), return the sum of the elements of the binary search tree 
within the range.

For example, given the following tree:

    5
   / \
  3   8
 / \ / \
2  4 6  10

and the range [4, 9], return 23 (5 + 4 + 6 + 8).


Problem 247

Given a binary tree, determine whether or not it is height-balanced. A height-balanced binary tree can be defined 
as one in which the heights of the two subtrees of any node never differ by more than one.

Prblem 223 
Typically, an implementation of in-order traversal of a binary tree has O(h) space complexity, where h is the height 
of the tree. Write a program to compute the in-order traversal of a binary tree using O(1) space.



Problem 196

Given the root of a binary tree, find the most frequent subtree sum. The subtree sum of a node is the sum of all 
values under a node, including the node itself.

For example, given the following tree:

  5
 / \
2  -5

Return 2 as it occurs twice: once as the left leaf, and once as the sum of 2 + 5 - 5.


Problem 254
-------------
Recall that a full binary tree is one in which each node is either a leaf node, or has two children. Given a binary tree, convert it to a full one by removing nodes with only one child.

For example, given the following tree:

         a
      /     \
    b         c
  /            \
d                 e
  \             /   \
    f          g     h

You should convert it to:

     a
  /     \
f         e
        /   \
       g     h


Problem 278

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given an integer N, construct all possible binary search trees with N nodes.

Problem 204



Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes in faster than O(n) time. Recall that a complete binary tree has every level filled except the last, and the nodes in the last level are filled starting from the left.


Problem 146

Given a binary tree where all nodes are either 0 or 1, prune the tree so that subtrees containing all 0s are removed.

For example, given the following tree:

   0
  / \
 1   0
    / \
   1   0
  / \
 0   0

should be pruned to:

   0
  / \
 1   0
    /
   1

We do not remove the tree at the root or its left child because it still has a 1 as a descendant.


Problem 284

Two nodes in a binary tree can be called cousins if they are on the same level of the tree but have different parents. For example, in the following diagram 4 and 6 are cousins.

    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \   \
4   5   6

Given a binary tree and a particular node, find all cousins of that node.

HEAP
----------------

Problem 33

Compute the running median of a sequence of numbers. That is, given a stream of numbers, print out the median of the list so far on each new element.

Recall that the median of an even-numbered list is the average of the two middle numbers.

For example, given the sequence [2, 1, 5, 7, 2, 0, 5], your algorithm should print out:

2
1.5
2
3.5
2
2
2


Problem 257

Given an array of integers out of order, determine the bounds of the smallest window that must be sorted 
in order for the entire array to be sorted. For example, given [3, 7, 5, 6, 9], you should return (1, 3).

SLICE

CONCEPTS 
-------------------------

PALINDROM 
----------

Problem 202

Write a program that checks whether an integer is a palindrome. For example, 121 is a palindrome, as well as 888. 
678 is not a palindrome. Do not convert the integer into a string.


Problem 

Find the next smallest palindrom for given digit. 

PROBLEM 167

Given a list of words, find all pairs of unique indices such that the concatenation of the two words is a palindrome.

For example, given the list ["code", "edoc", "da", "d"], return [(0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 3)].


Problem 157: 
Given a string, determine whether any permutation of it is a palindrome.

For example, carrace should return true, since it can be rearranged to form racecar, which is a palindrome. daily should return false, since there's no rearrangement that can form a palindrome.


SLIDING WINDOW 
------------------

Given an array of integers and a number k, where 1 <= k <= length of the array, compute the maximum values of each subarray of length k.

For example, given array = [10, 5, 2, 7, 8, 7] and k = 3, we should get: [10, 7, 8, 8], since:

10 = max(10, 5, 2)
7 = max(5, 2, 7)
8 = max(2, 7, 8)
8 = max(7, 8, 7)

Do this in O(n) time and O(k) space. You can modify the input array in-place and you do not need to store the results. You can simply print them out as you compute them.


STEPS
-------------

Problem 12

There exists a staircase with N steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2 steps at a time. Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.

For example, if N is 4, then there are 5 unique ways:

1, 1, 1, 1
2, 1, 1
1, 2, 1
1, 1, 2
2, 2

What if, instead of being able to climb 1 or 2 steps at a time, you could climb any number from a set of positive integers X? For example, if X = {1, 3, 5}, you could climb 1, 3, or 5 steps at a time.


SORTING 
---------------------

External sorting (To DO)

Problem 251

Given an array of a million integers between zero and a billion, out of order, how can you efficiently sort it? Assume that you cannot store an array of a billion elements in memory.

Problem 147

Given a list, sort it using this method: reverse(lst, i, j), which sorts lst from i to j.










DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING 
----------------------------

Problem 21
Given an array of time intervals (start, end) for classroom lectures (possibly overlapping), find the minimum number of rooms required.

For example, given [(30, 75), (0, 50), (60, 150)], you should return 2.



Problem 

You are given an array of integers, where each element represents the maximum number of steps that can be jumped going forward from that element. Write a function to return the minimum number of jumps you must take in order to get from the start to the end of the array.

For example, given [6, 2, 4, 0, 5, 1, 1, 4, 2, 9], you should return 2, as the optimal solution involves jumping from 6 to 5, and then from 5 to 9.


Problem 192

You are given an array of nonnegative integers. Let's say you start at the beginning of the array and are trying to advance to the end. You can advance at most, the number of steps that you're currently on. Determine whether you can get to the end of the array.

For example, given the array [1, 3, 1, 2, 0, 1], we can go from indices 0 -> SE



SERIALIZE & DESERIALIZE 
-----------------------------

Problem 3

Given the root to a binary tree, implement serialize(root), which serializes the tree into a string, and deserialize(s), which deserializes the string back into the tree.
