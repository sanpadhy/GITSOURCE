BITWISE OPERATOR 
------------------------------------

Problem 310 

Write an algorithm that finds the total number of set bits in all integers between 1 and N.


Problem 217


We say a number is sparse if there are no adjacent ones in its binary representation. For example, 21 (10101) is sparse, but 22 (10110) is not. For a given input N, find the smallest sparse number greater than or equal to N.

Do this in faster than O(N log N) time.

Problem 

Given a 32-bit positive integer N, determine whether it is a power of four in faster than O(log N) time.


Problem 248
Find the maximum of two numbers without using any if-else statements, branching, or direct comparisons.


Problem 161: 
Given a 32-bit integer, return the number with its bits reversed.

For example, given the binary number 1111 0000 1111 0000 1111 0000 1111 0000, return 0000 1111 0000 1111 0000 1111 0000 1111.

Problem 338

Given an integer n, find the next biggest integer with the same number of 1-bits on. For example, given the number 6 (0110 in binary), return 9 (1001).













MATHMATICS 
------------------------

Problem 362

A strobogrammatic number is a positive number that appears the same after being rotated 180 degrees. 
For example, 16891 is strobogrammatic.

Create a program that finds all strobogrammatic numbers with N digits.

Problem 339 
Given an array of numbers and a number k, determine if there are three entries in the array which add up to the 
specified number k. For example, given [20, 303, 3, 4, 25] and k = 49, return true as 20 + 4 + 25 = 49.

Sort and take one number which might be part of 3 series and check for pair whise sum is equals of sum - current. 

JUMP PROBLEMS
-------------------

Problem 322

Starting from 0 on a number line, you would like to make a series of jumps that lead to the integer N.

On the ith jump, you may move exactly i places to the left or right.

Find a path with the fewest number of jumps required to get from 0 to N.





RECURSIVE 
-------------------

pROBLEM 353

You are given a histogram consisting of rectangles of different heights. These heights are represented in an input 
list, such that [1, 3, 2, 5] corresponds to the following diagram:

      x
      x  
  x   x
  x x x
x x x x

Determine the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed only from the bars of the histogram. For the diagram 
above, for example, this would be six, representing the 2 x 3 area at the bottom right.


Problem 320

Given a string, find the length of the smallest window that contains every distinct character. Characters may appear more than once in the window.

For example, given "jiujitsu", you should return 5, corresponding to the final five letters.


Problem 233
Implement the function fib(n), which returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence, using only O(1) space.





ARRAY
-------------------------------

Problem 243

Given an array of numbers N and an integer k, your task is to split N into k partitions such that the maximum 
sum of any partition is minimized. Return this sum.

For example, given N = [5, 1, 2, 7, 3, 4] and k = 3, you should return 8, since the optimal partition 
is [5, 1, 2], [7], [3, 4].


Problem 271

Given a sorted list of integers of length N, determine if an element x is in the list without performing any 
multiplication, division, or bit-shift operations.

Do this in O(log N) time.


Problem 273

A fixed point in an array is an element whose value is equal to its index. Given a sorted array of distinct 
elements, return a fixed point, if one exists. Otherwise, return False.

For example, given [-6, 0, 2, 40], you should return 2. Given [1, 5, 7, 8], you should return False.


Problem 296

Given a sorted array, convert it into a height-balanced binary search tree.


Problem 358 

Create a data structure that performs all the following operations in O(1) time:

    plus: Add a key with value 1. If the key already exists, increment its value by one.
    minus: Decrement the value of a key. If the key's value is currently 1, remove it.
    get_max: Return a key with the highest value.
    get_min: Return a key with the lowest value.

In the above problem plus and minus, you wanted to do it in O(1) time 

    use hashmap with key(value) and value(count). 

To get the max and min, have a separate list for max and min. 

or have a arry of structure having 

--> key 
--> value 
--> current max 
--> current min

add() -- will add the count with count 

delete() -- reduce the count 


Problem 364

Describe an algorithm to compute the longest increasing subsequence of an array of numbers in O(n log n) time.


problem 224

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given a sorted array, find the smallest positive integer that is not the sum of a subset of the array.

For example, for the input [1, 2, 3, 10], you should return 7.

Do this in O(N) time.

Problem 198

Given a set of distinct positive integers, find the largest subset such that every pair of elements in the subset (i, j) 
satisfies either i % j = 0 or j % i = 0.

For example, given the set [3, 5, 10, 20, 21], you should return [5, 10, 20]. Given [1, 3, 6, 24], return [1, 3, 6, 24].

Problem 186

Given an array of positive integers, divide the array into two subsets such that the difference between the sum of 
the subsets is as small as possible.

For example, given [5, 10, 15, 20, 25], return the sets {10, 25} and {5, 15, 20}, which has a difference of 5, 
which is the smallest possible difference.

Problem 249

Given an array of integers, find the maximum XOR of any two elements.


Problem 245

You are given an array of integers, where each element represents the maximum number of steps that can be jumped 
going forward from that element. Write a function to return the minimum number of jumps you must take in order to 
get from the start to the end of the array.

For example, given [6, 2, 4, 0, 5, 1, 1, 4, 2, 9], you should return 2, as the optimal solution involves jumping from 
6 to 5, and then from 5 to 9.

Problem 203: 
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand. Find the minimum 
element in O(log N) time. You may assume the array does not contain duplicates.

For example, given [5, 7, 10, 3, 4], return 3.





STACK 
-------------------

Problem 365

A quack is a data structure combining properties of both stacks and queues. It can be viewed as a list of elements 
written left to right such that three operations are possible:

    push(x): add a new item x to the left end of the list
    pop(): remove and return the item on the left end of the list
    pull(): remove the item on the right end of the list.

Implement a quack using three stacks and O(1) additional memory, so that the amortized time for any push, pop, or 
pull operation is O(1).












QUEUE 
------------------------

PROBLEM 180

Given a stack of N elements, interleave the first half of the stack with the second half reversed using only 
one other queue. This should be done in-place.

Recall that you can only push or pop from a stack, and enqueue or dequeue from a queue.

For example, if the stack is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], it should become [1, 5, 2, 4, 3]. If the stack is [1, 2, 3, 4], it should 
become [1, 4, 2, 3].

Hint: Try working backwards from the end state.










CIRCULAR QUEUE 
------------------------

Problem 225

There are N prisoners standing in a circle, waiting to be executed. The executions are carried out starting with the kth person, and removing every successive kth person going clockwise until there is no one left.

Given N and k, write an algorithm to determine where a prisoner should stand in order to be the last survivor.

For example, if N = 5 and k = 2, the order of executions would be [2, 4, 1, 5, 3], so you should return 3.

Bonus: Find an O(log N) solution if k = 2.






HASH MAP / MAP / DICTIONARY (KEY-VALUE)
-------------------------------









SET 
------------------




LINKED LIST 
------------------

Problem 305: 
Given a linked list, remove all consecutive nodes that sum to zero. Print out the remaining nodes.

For example, suppose you are given the input 3 -> 4 -> -7 -> 5 -> -6 -> 6. In this case, you should first 
remove 3 -> 4 -> -7, then -6 -> 6, leaving only 5.




Given a linked list, rearrange the node values such that they appear in alternating low -> high -> low -> high ... form. For example, given 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, you should return 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5 -> 4.


Given a linked list of numbers and a pivot k, partition the linked list so that all nodes less than k come before nodes greater than or equal to k.

For example, given the linked list 5 -> 1 -> 8 -> 0 -> 3 and k = 3, the solution could be 1 -> 0 -> 5 -> 8 -> 3.











GRAPH 
---------------------------

Problem 262

A bridge in a connected (undirected) graph is an edge that, if removed, causes the graph to become disconnected. 
Find all the bridges in a graph.


Problem 299

A group of houses is connected to the main water plant by means of a set of pipes. A house can either be connected by a set of pipes extending directly to the plant, or indirectly by a pipe to a nearby house which is otherwise connected.

For example, here is a possible configuration, where A, B, and C are houses, and arrows represent pipes: A <--> B <--> C <--> plant

Each pipe has an associated cost, which the utility company would like to minimize. Given an undirected graph of pipe connections, return the lowest cost configuration of pipes such that each house has access to water.

In the following setup, for example, we can remove all but the pipes from plant to A, plant to B, and B to C, for a total cost of 16.

pipes = {
    'plant': {'A': 1, 'B': 5, 'C': 20},
    'A': {'C': 15},
    'B': {'C': 10},
    'C': {}
}








BINARY TREE 
--------------------------

Problem 343

Given a binary search tree and a range [a, b] (inclusive), return the sum of the elements of the binary search tree 
within the range.

For example, given the following tree:

    5
   / \
  3   8
 / \ / \
2  4 6  10

and the range [4, 9], return 23 (5 + 4 + 6 + 8).


Problem 247

Given a binary tree, determine whether or not it is height-balanced. A height-balanced binary tree can be defined 
as one in which the heights of the two subtrees of any node never differ by more than one.


Problem 196

Given the root of a binary tree, find the most frequent subtree sum. The subtree sum of a node is the sum of all 
values under a node, including the node itself.

For example, given the following tree:

  5
 / \
2  -5

Return 2 as it occurs twice: once as the left leaf, and once as the sum of 2 + 5 - 5.


Problem 254
-------------
Recall that a full binary tree is one in which each node is either a leaf node, or has two children. Given a binary tree, convert it to a full one by removing nodes with only one child.

For example, given the following tree:

         a
      /     \
    b         c
  /            \
d                 e
  \             /   \
    f          g     h

You should convert it to:

     a
  /     \
f         e
        /   \
       g     h


Problem 278

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given an integer N, construct all possible binary search trees with N nodes.

Problem 204

Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes in faster than O(n) time. Recall that a complete binary tree has every level filled except the last, and the nodes in the last level are filled starting from the left.


Problem 146

Given a binary tree where all nodes are either 0 or 1, prune the tree so that subtrees containing all 0s are removed.

For example, given the following tree:

   0
  / \
 1   0
    / \
   1   0
  / \
 0   0

should be pruned to:

   0
  / \
 1   0
    /
   1

We do not remove the tree at the root or its left child because it still has a 1 as a descendant.


Problem 284

Two nodes in a binary tree can be called cousins if they are on the same level of the tree but have different parents. For example, in the following diagram 4 and 6 are cousins.

    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \   \
4   5   6

Given a binary tree and a particular node, find all cousins of that node.

HEAP
----------------

Problem 257

Given an array of integers out of order, determine the bounds of the smallest window that must be sorted 
in order for the entire array to be sorted. For example, given [3, 7, 5, 6, 9], you should return (1, 3).

CONCEPTS 
-------------------------

PALINDROM 
----------

Problem 

Find the next smallest palindrom for given digit. 

PROBLEM 167

Given a list of words, find all pairs of unique indices such that the concatenation of the two words is a palindrome.

For example, given the list ["code", "edoc", "da", "d"], return [(0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 3)].


Problem 157: 
Given a string, determine whether any permutation of it is a palindrome.

For example, carrace should return true, since it can be rearranged to form racecar, which is a palindrome. daily should return false, since there's no rearrangement that can form a palindrome.






SORTING 
---------------------

External sorting (To DO)

Problem 251

Given an array of a million integers between zero and a billion, out of order, how can you efficiently sort it? Assume that you cannot store an array of a billion elements in memory.





STRING 
------------------

Problem 276 (TO DO)

Implement an efficient string matching algorithm.

That is, given a string of length N and a pattern of length k, write a program that searches for the pattern in the string with less than O(N * k) worst-case time complexity.

If the pattern is found, return the start index of its location. If not, return False.

Problem 253
Given a string and a number of lines k, print the string in zigzag form. In zigzag, characters are printed out diagonally from top left to bottom right until reaching the kth line, then back up to top right, and so on.

For example, given the sentence "thisisazigzag" and k = 4, you should print:

t     a     g
 h   s z   a
  i i   i z
   s     g


Problem 153

Find an efficient algorithm to find the smallest distance (measured in number of words) between any two given words in a string.

For example, given words "hello", and "world" and a text content of "dog cat hello cat dog dog hello cat world", return 1 because there's only one word "cat" in between the two words.









DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING 
----------------------------

You are given an array of integers, where each element represents the maximum number of steps that can be jumped going forward from that element. Write a function to return the minimum number of jumps you must take in order to get from the start to the end of the array.

For example, given [6, 2, 4, 0, 5, 1, 1, 4, 2, 9], you should return 2, as the optimal solution involves jumping from 6 to 5, and then from 5 to 9.








SPECIAL FUNCTIONS 
------------------------------
Given a sorted list of integers of length N, determine if an element x is in the list without performing any multiplication, division, or bit-shift operations.

Do this in O(log N) time.

Bisect function -- Insert the var to array in such a way array is sorted and return position.
