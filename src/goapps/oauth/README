Client that will start by making an authorization request to the resource owner. 
The resource owner then either grants or denies this request.

With this authorization grant the client then passes this to the authorization server 
which will grant back an access token. It is with this granted access token that our client 
can then access a protected resource such as an API or a service.

Using the goOAuth2 we will build the Autherization server.
