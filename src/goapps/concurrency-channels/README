############### CHANNELS WITH GOROUTINES #############################


one goroutine sends a value to this channel, that goroutine will subsequently block until the value is received from the channel. 

If I have a multiple goroutines using the same channel 

c <- value has blocked in our second goroutine and subsequently the main() function concludes itâ€™s execution before our second goroutine gets a chance to complete its own execution.

In this scenario when you need more value to be collected you need buffered channel. 

bufferedChannel := make(chan int, 3)
