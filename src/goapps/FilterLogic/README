Filtering on a slice of records. 

filtering in-line, looping through your set of records and discarding whatever records donâ€™t match your business requirements.

Go libraries that provide map/reduce-esque functions. 

Filter is a single filter function. Each record in a slice will be checked against the filter function and kept or discarded based on the boolean return value. 

FilterBulk is a similar type, but applies to the entire slice of records, rather than an individual record.


Each one of our filters will implement one of these two types, and then we can chain them together to create sets of filters.
