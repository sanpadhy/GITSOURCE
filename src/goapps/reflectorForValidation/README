##################  REFLECTOR   ############################

With reflect package we were able to extract basic information about our User struct, its type and kind and also list of all of its fields.

field.Tag.Get method will return a string that matches the tag name

In This example struct tags are used to perform the validation. few validator types (numeric, string, email) using interface pattern.

reflect.ValueOf we can grab the field value using v.Field(i).Interface() which gives us an interface that we can pass for validation. 

get type of the field using v.Type().Field(i).
