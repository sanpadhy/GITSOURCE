#######################  LINKER . To Build the clean clode .. #########################

Use the Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control for building well-formed project architecture.

    components registry
    dependency injection
    circular dependency detection
    post-construction (injection) initialization
    automatic prioritization for components initialization
    automatic prioritization for components shutdown

In Linker Dependency Injection is a process of assigning fields of a registered components by values of other registered components. For understanding, which fields of components should be injected, Linker expects the fields be annotated special way.

The “Post Construction” is a procedure by notifying some of registered components when all components dependencies have been resolved successfully.
