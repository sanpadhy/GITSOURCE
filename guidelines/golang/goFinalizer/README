Runtime.SetFinalizer that allows developers to attach a function to a variable that will be called when the garbage collector sees this variable as garbage ready to be collected since it became unreachable.

The finalizer is scheduled to run at some arbitrary time after the program can no longer reach the object to which obj points. There is no guarantee that finalizers will run before a program exits, so typically they are useful only for releasing non-memory resources associated with an object during a long-running program.
